## Project introduction
Due to design and operational discrepancies, sensor or actuator malfunctions, and rule-based control mechanisms, the year-round energy efficiency ratio (EER) of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in Chinese commercial buildings typically falls within the range of 2.5 to 3.0. This is significantly lower than the recommended 5.0 EER set by the ASHRAE standard. The current inefficiency presents a notable opportunity to decrease energy consumption and carbon emissions in Chinese commercial buildings.<br>

In this project, we aim to collaborate with researchers from the Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) in order to develop a smart energy system. This system will focus on improving the energy efficiency of large-scale commercial buildings through load prediction, fault detection, and advanced building control.
