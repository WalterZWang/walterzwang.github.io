## Funding agency
Tencent Young Faculty Open Research Fund, 2023-2024 

## Project introduction
Data center accounts for 3% of total electricity consumption (i.e. 350 TWh per year) in China, among which 30-40% are for data center cooling. Enhancing the energy efficiency of data center cooling system has significant energy saving and carbon emission reduction potential. In this project, we will develop and deploy Model Predictive Control for data center cooling system.
