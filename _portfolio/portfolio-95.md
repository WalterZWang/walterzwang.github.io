## Project introduction
With the penetration of renewable generation, demand response becomes increasingly important to maintain real-time balance for the grid. Buildings, as a major electricity consumer and with significant thermal mass, have large potential to deliever grid services. However, conventional Rule-Based control is diffcult to respond to the grid signal in the most efficient way. This research aims to unlock this potential using Model Predictive Control. The controller will be deployed in a real office building located in Midea Campus.
