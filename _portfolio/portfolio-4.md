## Project introduction
This endeavor aims to create a comprehensive building energy model at the urban level for Hong Kong through a bottom-up physics-oriented methodology. To accomplish this objective, we designed an automated system for generating building energy models. This system gathers information from Geographic Information Systems, as well as open data sources provided by governmental and industrial entities. In order to streamline the process of urban-scale building energy modeling, we devised algorithms for simplifying building footprints, automating thermal zoning, and modeling shading through the utilization of ray-tracing techniques. Details about this tool are explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OY-GSBhMIc) <br/>
Additionally, we created a publicly accessible interactive web tool [here](http://cez027.ce.ust.hk/HongKongUrbanEnergy/UrbanEnergy.html).
