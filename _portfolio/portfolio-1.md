## Project introduction
Smart green buildings are instrumental in the pursuit of carbon neutrality and the enhancement of the built environment. Our research project encompasses three key tasks aimed at advancing this objective.<br>
Task 1 involves an in-depth examination of user behavior during demand response events. By studying how individuals respond and adapt their energy consumption patterns during these events, we can gain valuable insights into effective strategies for demand management and optimization.<br>
In Task 2, our focus lies in the development of advanced methodologies for load prediction, parameter identification, and system optimization within the context of multi-energy systems in buildings. This entails devising models and algorithms that can accurately forecast energy loads, identify crucial system parameters, and optimize overall system performance for improved energy efficiency.<br>
Task 3 revolves around the exploration and investigation of multi-agent collaboration frameworks and mechanisms specifically designed for load coordination across multiple buildings. By establishing effective communication and coordination methods among interconnected buildings, we can achieve enhanced load balancing and energy optimization on a broader scale.<br>
Through the systematic pursuit of these research tasks, we aim to contribute to the advancement of smart green buildings, ultimately fostering the realization of carbon neutrality goals and the overall improvement of the built environment.<br>
