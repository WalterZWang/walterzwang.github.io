This course provides theory and hands-on experience about energy system modelling for buildings and cities.

## Background
Energy system is an important part of smart low-carbon buildings and cities. Energy system modelling is the prerequisite for load prediction, energy efficiency design and optimization, which becomes increasingly important under the context of climate change and sustainable development. 

## Contents
This course provides theory and hands-on experience about energy system modelling for buildings and cities. Lectures will cover physical concepts, mathematical laws, and software tools for city and building energy system modelling. On the theory side, this course will cover heat transfer basics and building thermal dynamics. On the practical side, this course will introduce the equation-based programming language Modelica. On the scale side, this course will cover building-scale energy system (HVAC) and the city-scale energy system (district heating and cooling system).

This course has four modules: review of thermal fundamentals, math and programming of dynamic systems, major components of HVAC system, and energy system modeling at different scales.
