- I am an Assistant Professor in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home).
- **PhD & Postdoc Opening**: I am looking for PhD students and Postdocs to work on smart building and building control starting from Spring/Autumn 2023. Students in building science, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, or related majors with proficient coding skills are welcome to apply. Building modelling (EnergyPlus, Modelica preferred) or/and machine learning skill/experience is a plus. Please feel free to contact me with CV (and/or transcripts, sample publications) attached if you are interested. For more information, please check the [PhD (CIVL) program](https://prog-crs.ust.hk/pgprog/2020-21/mphil-phd-civl%20) and the [HKUST Graduate School](https://pg.ust.hk/prospective-students/home).
- Prior to joining HKUST, I was a Project Scientist in [Building Technology & Urban Systems Division](https://buildings.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 2018 to 2021. I received my Ph.D. in School of Architecture at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Yingxin Zhu](http://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/Building%20Science%20and%20Technology/1825) and [Prof. Borong Lin](http://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/Building%20Science%20and%20Technology/1804), in 2017. I received my M.Phil degree in [Department of Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge in 2014, and B.Eng. degree in School of Architecture at Tsinghua University in 2011.
- My current research interest is on smart building and building control. My broad research interests include model-based and data-driven performance enhancement for buildings and cities
